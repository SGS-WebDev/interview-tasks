# Frontend Developer Challenge: Sales Data Dashboard üìä

## Overview

Welcome! In this challenge, you'll build a dashboard that displays sales data using React and TypeScript.

You may use any React setup and charting library you prefer. Choose tools that let you work most effectively!

## Time Expectation

- ~4 hours for core requirements
- Additional time for bonus features (optional)

## Core Requirements

### 1. Dashboard Display

Create a dashboard that shows:
- Key sales metrics
- Data visualizations (charts/graphs)
- Product performance data

### 2. Data Fetching

- Fetch data from the provided API endpoint
- Handle loading and error states
- Display the data appropriately

### 3. Visualizations

Include at least 2 different types of data visualizations using any charting library of your choice.

### 4. Documentation

- README with setup and run instructions
- Note which charting library you chose and why

## API Endpoint

```
GET https://api.jsonbin.io/v3/b/65b5f8b01f5677401f20d0cc
```

## Mock Data Structure

If you prefer to work with local data instead of the API, here's the complete mock data:

```typescript
const mockSalesData = {
  record: {
    salesData: {

      totalOrders: 342,
      averageOrderValue: 425.35,
