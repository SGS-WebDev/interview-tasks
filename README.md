# Developer Interview Challenges üöÄ

Welcome! This repository contains technical challenges for various developer positions. These challenges are designed to
assess your coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and attention to detail.

## üìö Important: Use of Resources and Code Review

**You may use any resources you'd like** to complete these challenges, including:
- Internet searches and documentation
- AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.)
- Stack Overflow and other forums
- Any other resources that help you solve problems

However, please be aware that after submission, we'll schedule a brief **10-minute code walkthrough** where you'll:
- Explain how your solution works
- Discuss specific implementation decisions
- Answer questions about various parts of your code

**A friendly warning:** If you submit code you don't understand, it will become immediately apparent during the review and will reflect poorly on your candidacy. We strongly encourage you to:
- Only use code you can explain
- Take time to understand any generated or borrowed code
- Be prepared to discuss trade-offs and alternatives

We value honesty and learning ability over memorization. It's perfectly fine to say "I researched this approach and here's why I chose it" during your review.

## üéØ How This Works

1. **Browse Available Challenges**: Each role has its own folder containing one or more challenge options
2. **Choose ONE Challenge**: Select a single challenge that best matches your skills and the position you're applying
   for
3. **Complete the Challenge**: Follow the instructions in the challenge description (eg.
   `junior-frontend-developer/interactive-dashboard-widget.md`)
4. **Submit Your Work**: Create a new GitHub repository with your solution and share the link with us

## üìã General Guidelines

### Time Investment

- Most challenges are designed to take **~4 hours** for core requirements
- Optional bonus features can be added if you have extra time
- Quality over quantity. Focus on clean, working code rather than rushing through features

### What We're Looking For

- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and maintainable code
- **Code Progression**: Logical git commit history showing your thought process
- **Problem Solving**: How you approach and solve technical challenges
- **Best Practices**: Following industry standards and conventions
- **Documentation**: Clear instructions and code comments where helpful
- **Attention to Detail**: Following the requirements and guidelines

### Submission Process

1. Create a **public GitHub repository** for your solution
2. Include a clear README with:
    - Setup instructions
    - How to run your solution
    - Any assumptions or decisions you made
    - Technologies used
3. If applicable, deploy a live demo (using services like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages)
4. Send us:
    - Link to your GitHub repository
    - Link to live demo (if applicable)
    - Any additional notes about your solution

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Read Carefully**: Review the entire challenge before starting
2. **Plan First**: Spend time planning your approach before coding
3. **Ask Questions**: If something is unclear, make reasonable assumptions and document them
4. **Version Control**: Make regular commits with meaningful messages
5. **Test Your Work**: Ensure your solution works as expected before submitting
6. **Be Yourself**: Show us your coding style and problem-solving approach
